  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been asked by a lot of my friends at school what value can they
get from LinkedIn beyond just searching for jobs and connecting with classmates.
While LinkedIn has a lot of great features, I think three are particularly
helpful for the average college student.</p>

<h2>LinkedIn Today</h2>

<p>LinkedIn Today was released last year and currently sits at the top of everyone&#8217;s
news feed. The product is basically a customizable smart newspaper for each user
and allows them to pick industries that they want to be in the know how for.
Since the top stories are calculated based by shares and reading behaviors of
professionals in that industry, a student can easily see what news important
for his or her prospective industry. This can be particularly helpful for making
sure that he or she is informed before going into an interview.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today">http://www.linkedin.com/today</a></p>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>A lot of students end up joining university or student activity based groups,
such as fraternity or sorority. While these groups do have job postings, I think
a lot of the value of groups comes from interest based groups. There tends to be
rich discussion there about the topic and provides an opportunity for you get
more informed but also connect with professionals that you may not have connected
with before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory">http://www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory</a></p>

<h2>Career Explorer</h2>

<p>I noticed this tool under the Jobs menu once but it seems to have disappeared
now. The tool says that it is in Beta so it might not be available to everyone
but it allows students to plan out their careers one level at a time and see
average salaries at each level. This is helpful for planning long term and
deciding between different fields.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed CyanogenMod 7.1 onto my Samsung Captivate because I was
getting sick of using the default ROM. One of the things that I noticed was SMS
messages received while the phone was off or in flight mode had the timestamp of
when they arrived to the phone as opposed to when they were sent. If you want to
get the time that was sent, follow the directions below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the settings to use Sent timestamp</li>
<li>Change the settings to use the GMT timestamp just to make sure all timestamps
come in the same way</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mattprecious.smsfix&amp;hl=en">SMS Time Fix</a></li>
<li>Activate SMS Time Fix in the settings</li>
<li>Set the adjustment time to be either add or subtract time zone depending where
you are in relation to GMT</li>
</ol>


<p>I hope this helps. As a note, if you&#8217;re using CyanogenMod 7.1, the RC1 seems to
more stable than the Stable version. I&#8217;ve had less force closes and no boot loops
so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I lived in NorCal this summer while I had an internship in Silicon Valley. Since
the company I worked for gave me some money for shipping, I shipped some of my
possessions from my dorm room such as my TV and Xbox. They made it to California
perfectly alright and gave me a lot of satisfaction while I was out there. When
it came time to ship it back, I left my box with a friend so he could put a few
small items in there and then ship it for me. He choose to ship it with PostNet
and <strong>$500 of insurance</strong> which turned out to be a terrible mistake.</p>

<h3>August</h3>

<p>When I received the package at school, I began dutifully unpacking my box and
setting up everything inside. After plugging in my Xbox and TV, I discovered
that the Xbox would turn on but not display video or produce sound. After a
quick Google search, I discovered that the common cause for this was that the
video card had died which is usually caused by heat exposure. I figured that my
box had just been left on a tarmac somewhere. I calmly filed a report with UPS
that my box had been damaged. The report was filed by UPS because that&#8217;s what
the shipping label had said.</p>

<h3>September</h3>

<p>After a long time of not hearing back from UPS, I tried checking their website,
calling them and investigating my account. All of which provided me no new
information. In fact, my account did not even have a record of the claim. After
tweeting angrily about the claim, UPS help responded and had me email them. The
support team had told me that the claim had been offloaded to PostNet and I
should contact them, which I promptly did. PostNet responded that I needed to go
to a repair vendor, such as Best Buy, and get a note about repair or replacement
costs. Since Best Buy was not able to fix my Xbox, I sent back a note and a the
cost of a replacement.</p>

<h3>October</h3>

<p>After not hearing from PostNet for a long time, I decided to call them and see
what was happening. They told me that UPS would call me about sending a
representative to examine the evidence and I thanked them again for their time.
When UPS called me, they asked me if I still had the box. Since I live in a
dorm room, I had thrown it out for space which was a mistake I admit. The UPS
guy told me that was unfortunate but he would see what he could do with PostNet
to help me out because I had insurance on the box.</p>

<h3>November</h3>

<p>After sending an email to PostNet, I called them to investigate the status of
the claim. The manager informed me that the claim had been denied. I was mildly
annoyed that they had decided to not tell me at all. The manager claimed that
the UPS agent had told me my claim was denied. When I tried to tell him what the
UPS agent had told me, the manager shut me down and was extremely unhelpful.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>The moral of the story is don&#8217;t ship with PostNet. Also, probably don&#8217;t buy
insurance on a package because it doesn&#8217;t help anyway.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>I know I should have kept the box, that was definitely a mistake</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi, everyone, so I&#8217;m a big fan of Chris Kempson&#8217;s Tomorrow Theme which
can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme">https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme</a>
For a long time there was no support for GEdit, the wonderful text editor
for gnome. Recently, I was made aware of a tool for converting Textmate
themes and made a pull request. You can now find a GEdit version of the
theme in the repo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a huge fan of github and using them for my projects. Recently, I discovered
the power of their project pages and have been using them to host my javascript
based applications, both for code and display. When I launched my Octopress site
however, my project pages disappeared. In order to make the page come back, all
I needed to do was make a minor change and force the project page to be rebuilt.
Fortunately, you only need to do this once and the changes stick. Hope this
helps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I got Minecraft for my birthday, which started this whole adventure.
I have a laptop and don&#8217;t own a USB mouse which makes playing slightly
difficult. I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of the mouse and keyboard for games,
which I know is basically heresy, so I decided to setup my computer to use
an Xbox 360 controller. I&#8217;m running Elementary OS Jupiter which is a
derivative of Ubuntu.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>In order to make this work, you&#8217;ll need a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>An official USB Xbox 360 controller. Now I&#8217;m not sure if you absolutely need
an official Xbox 360 controller but I&#8217;ve had issues in the past with 3rd
party controllers so I would highly recommend it.</li>
<li>Xboxdrv, <a href="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/xboxdrv.html">http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/xboxdrv.html</a></li>
<li>An Xboxdrv configuration file, conveniently displayed below</li>
</ul>


<h2>Minecraft.xboxdrv</h2>

<p>The following xboxdrv file will set up your Xbox controller</p>

<h2>The Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>The left joystick is WASD</li>
<li>The right joystick is the view with normal configuration. You can created an
inverted look by shifting the controls.</li>
<li>A is jump</li>
<li>B and Right bumper are crouch</li>
<li>X is drop</li>
<li>Y is talk</li>
<li>Right Trigger is break</li>
<li>Left Trigger is place</li>
<li>Left Bumper shows who is on the server</li>
<li>Select shows the menu</li>
<li>Start shows inventory</li>
</ul>


<h2>Starting the controller</h2>

<p>If you want to turn on the controller easily, place the configuration file in
the same directory as the minecraft jar launcher and name is
<code>minecraft.xboxrdv</code>. Then add this line to your <code>.bashrc</code> file:
<code>alias xbox='sudo rmmod xpad; sudo xboxdrv -c minecraft.xboxdrv --silent'</code></p>
