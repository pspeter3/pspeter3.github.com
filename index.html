  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the new Google+ Redesign today, I&#8217;ve been thinking about what the role of
Google+ is within the context of other websites. Facebook is my social network,
LinkedIn is my professional network and Twitter is my information network, so
where does Google+ fit in? I&#8217;ve started to realize that I&#8217;ve been using Google+
to connect with communities. The main reason I check it is to see posts about
elementary OS, CyanogenMod and a few other projects which use the network to
talk to fans and alert them about updates. On a smaller scale, I&#8217;ve been using
the circles to control where I share information and essentially treating it as
a nicer form of email.</p>

<p>I think Google+ has a chance to be the community network, where people can
discuss and collaborate, especially through the hangout feature. This puts
Google+ less in competition with Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and more in
competition with Reddit where users already get news and discuss things about
certain topics.</p>

<p>TL;DR I think comparing Google+ to Reddit is more fitting than comparing it to
Twitter or Facebook.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few weeks, I had been working on a website called Alchemr with my
friend and business partner, Sander Kravet. The basic idea of the website was to
allow small content based websites to monetize by creating a paywall that did
consumer surveys. We had some small websites interested and were getting close
to finishing. Unfortunately, Google came out with <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home">Google Consumer Surveys</a>
which does the same exact thing and even had the same pricing structure we were
offering. Since our biggest issue was getting websites and business to accept
a new company like Alchemr, competing with Google seemed unwise. While it is
sad to give up on something so close to completion, I learned a lot during the
process and am glad to have had an idea that Google thought was good. The code
is now open source and can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/pspeter3/alchemr">https://github.com/pspeter3/alchemr</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I wrote a <a href="http://pspeter3.github.com/blog/2012/02/01/comparisons-of-task-managers/">comparison of various task managers</a>,
and talked about how I wanted to look more into <a href="http://www.wunderkit.com/">Wunderkit</a>.
Last night I finally had the opportunity to delve more into it and I have officially
switched to it. The app is just awesome.</p>

<h2>Criteria</h2>

<p>When looking for a task manager, I have several criteria that are ideal</p>

<ol>
<li>Due Dates (For a long time Google Tasks didn&#8217;t have these)</li>
<li>Contexts / Workspaces</li>
<li>Repeating Tasks (otherwise I forget to change my contacts)</li>
<li>Mobile Apps</li>
<li>Tagging</li>
<li>Collaborative Workspaces</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Wunderkit meets all of them.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every few months, I end up deciding if what current task manager I am using is
right for me. I initially used Remember the Milk and then switched to Google
Tasks before settling on NirvanaHQ. Now that I&#8217;ve been using NirvanaHQ, I&#8217;ve
decided to look around at other task managers.</p>

<h2>Astrid</h2>

<p>I tried Astrid when I first got my Android phone. One of my biggest annoyances
with NirvanaHQ is that they do not have an Android app and their mobile web app
is not great. I found Astrid to be very powerful but the interface wasn&#8217;t great
and sync didn&#8217;t always work. When it did sync to their website, I wasn&#8217;t a huge
fan of their webapp. If you&#8217;re only planning to use your task manager on your
phone, then Astrid may be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.astrid.com">http://www.astrid.com</a></p>

<h2>Todo.txt</h2>

<p>Being an avid Lifehacker reader for the last few years, I decided I would try
Gina Trapini&#8217;s Todo.txt. Since I was looking at multiple task managers, the idea
of keeping your data with you was extremely appealing. However, using the
command line all the time and the fact that you have to pay for the mobile apps
was not ideal. I actually discovered that I am more often near a web browser than
I am to a text editor.</p>

<p><a href="http://todotxt.com/">http://todotxt.com/</a></p>

<h2>Wunderlist</h2>

<p>Since I have an iPad and an Android phone, I was looking for something cross
platform. Wunderlist seemed to be an appealing option and is visually the most
stunning of all the apps. The web app, Android app and iPad app are all
gorgeous. My one problem with Wunderlist was that I had been spoiled by
NirvanaHQ. Wunderlist lacked a lot of the nice features of NirvanaHQ mainly
repeating tasks, subtasks, tags and schedule dates. Schedule dates is probably
the least important of them all. I&#8217;m going to keep my eye out on it for the
moment and see if I want to switch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wunderlist.com/">http://www.wunderlist.com/</a></p>

<h2>Workflowy</h2>

<p>My friend Stan Rosenthal suggested his followers to checkout Workflowy on his
twitter feed. Workflowy is probably the most unique task manager on this list.
Basically the concept is you get one gigantic unordered list which you can keep
adding tasks to and subtask all you want. Each subtask, you can also share with
people and let them finish projects. It&#8217;s a really cool idea but I found it to
be a little too chaotic for me to manage my tasks.</p>

<p><a href="https://workflowy.com/">https://workflowy.com/</a></p>

<h2>Wunderkit</h2>

<p>This is the more project based version of Wunderlist made by the same company.
Wunderkit basically takes Wunderlist and adds areas which have notes and status
updates. The cool thing is that you can share an area with a friend. I haven&#8217;t
really experimented with it too much yet but definitely let me know if you want
an invite in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve seen a lot of debate about the role of piracy on the internet. I
had decided not to write a post about it until I saw a post by my friend on his
blog, <a href="http://www.connor-g.com/2012/01/25/piracy-its-not-the-problem/">http://www.connor-g.com/2012/01/25/piracy-its-not-the-problem/</a>.
While the majority of his post is accurate, I feel like it is missing a major
piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Piracy <strong>is</strong> a big problem.</p>

<p>There is no other way around it. When you have people free riding on a system,
it impacts the system and can lead to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemna">Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemna</a>.
If users see others getting things for free, they have little incentive to pay for
it themselves which ultimately leads to no money for content creators.While anti-piracy laws do shift the
incentives, they are hard to enforce and thus are not really effective. The issue
is that piracy probably cannot be solved by legal forces nor can it be solved by
a blatant hatred of the Old Media companies. While I disagree with Chris Dodd&#8217;s
sentiment on the SOPA protest as an abuse of power, I do agree with his analysis
that Silicon Valley and Hollywood need to meet to talk about piracy.</p>

<p>New content models, specifically the idea of leasing content as opposed to
owning it, will probably be what saves Old Media and bring profits to both
Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Netflix and Spotify are the two most notable
example of this model. By subscribing to their streaming services, you essentially
lease content until you discontinue your subscription. By leasing the content,
individuals can&#8217;t distribute it as easily and you have services that are legal
and easy to use. The issue with these services is that as they become successful,
the Old Media companies want either more money which makes the service unprofitable
or stop releasing their library and try to create their own service. As we have
learned with premium cable channels, premium content needs to be bundled in order
for users to pay for it. The average user is unlikely to pay for each &#8220;channel&#8221;
individually. If they were willing, it would still be helpful to have a master
account through Netflix and Spotify to manage all of the payments.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the issue of piracy and content is a difficult and confusing issue
that will take many years to resolve. I think that putting blame on either
Silicon Valley or Hollywood is unproductive and won&#8217;t lead to the necessary
cooperation between both industries that will ultimately make people want to pay
for content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been asked by a lot of my friends at school what value can they
get from LinkedIn beyond just searching for jobs and connecting with classmates.
While LinkedIn has a lot of great features, I think three are particularly
helpful for the average college student.</p>

<h2>LinkedIn Today</h2>

<p>LinkedIn Today was released last year and currently sits at the top of everyone&#8217;s
news feed. The product is basically a customizable smart newspaper for each user
and allows them to pick industries that they want to be in the know how for.
Since the top stories are calculated based by shares and reading behaviors of
professionals in that industry, a student can easily see what news important
for his or her prospective industry. This can be particularly helpful for making
sure that he or she is informed before going into an interview.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today">http://www.linkedin.com/today</a></p>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>A lot of students end up joining university or student activity based groups,
such as fraternity or sorority. While these groups do have job postings, I think
a lot of the value of groups comes from interest based groups. There tends to be
rich discussion there about the topic and provides an opportunity for you get
more informed but also connect with professionals that you may not have connected
with before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory">http://www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory</a></p>

<h2>Career Explorer</h2>

<p>I noticed this tool under the Jobs menu once but it seems to have disappeared
now. The tool says that it is in Beta so it might not be available to everyone
but it allows students to plan out their careers one level at a time and see
average salaries at each level. This is helpful for planning long term and
deciding between different fields.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed CyanogenMod 7.1 onto my Samsung Captivate because I was
getting sick of using the default ROM. One of the things that I noticed was SMS
messages received while the phone was off or in flight mode had the timestamp of
when they arrived to the phone as opposed to when they were sent. If you want to
get the time that was sent, follow the directions below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the settings to use Sent timestamp</li>
<li>Change the settings to use the GMT timestamp just to make sure all timestamps
come in the same way</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mattprecious.smsfix&amp;hl=en">SMS Time Fix</a></li>
<li>Activate SMS Time Fix in the settings</li>
<li>Set the adjustment time to be either add or subtract time zone depending where
you are in relation to GMT</li>
</ol>


<p>I hope this helps. As a note, if you&#8217;re using CyanogenMod 7.1, the RC1 seems to
more stable than the Stable version. I&#8217;ve had less force closes and no boot loops
so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I lived in NorCal this summer while I had an internship in Silicon Valley. Since
the company I worked for gave me some money for shipping, I shipped some of my
possessions from my dorm room such as my TV and Xbox. They made it to California
perfectly alright and gave me a lot of satisfaction while I was out there. When
it came time to ship it back, I left my box with a friend so he could put a few
small items in there and then ship it for me. He choose to ship it with PostNet
and <strong>$500 of insurance</strong> which turned out to be a terrible mistake.</p>

<h3>August</h3>

<p>When I received the package at school, I began dutifully unpacking my box and
setting up everything inside. After plugging in my Xbox and TV, I discovered
that the Xbox would turn on but not display video or produce sound. After a
quick Google search, I discovered that the common cause for this was that the
video card had died which is usually caused by heat exposure. I figured that my
box had just been left on a tarmac somewhere. I calmly filed a report with UPS
that my box had been damaged. The report was filed by UPS because that&#8217;s what
the shipping label had said.</p>

<h3>September</h3>

<p>After a long time of not hearing back from UPS, I tried checking their website,
calling them and investigating my account. All of which provided me no new
information. In fact, my account did not even have a record of the claim. After
tweeting angrily about the claim, UPS help responded and had me email them. The
support team had told me that the claim had been offloaded to PostNet and I
should contact them, which I promptly did. PostNet responded that I needed to go
to a repair vendor, such as Best Buy, and get a note about repair or replacement
costs. Since Best Buy was not able to fix my Xbox, I sent back a note and a the
cost of a replacement.</p>

<h3>October</h3>

<p>After not hearing from PostNet for a long time, I decided to call them and see
what was happening. They told me that UPS would call me about sending a
representative to examine the evidence and I thanked them again for their time.
When UPS called me, they asked me if I still had the box. Since I live in a
dorm room, I had thrown it out for space which was a mistake I admit. The UPS
guy told me that was unfortunate but he would see what he could do with PostNet
to help me out because I had insurance on the box.</p>

<h3>November</h3>

<p>After sending an email to PostNet, I called them to investigate the status of
the claim. The manager informed me that the claim had been denied. I was mildly
annoyed that they had decided to not tell me at all. The manager claimed that
the UPS agent had told me my claim was denied. When I tried to tell him what the
UPS agent had told me, the manager shut me down and was extremely unhelpful.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>The moral of the story is don&#8217;t ship with PostNet. Also, probably don&#8217;t buy
insurance on a package because it doesn&#8217;t help anyway.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>I know I should have kept the box, that was definitely a mistake</li>
</ul>

For a long time there was no support for GEdit, the wonderful text editor
