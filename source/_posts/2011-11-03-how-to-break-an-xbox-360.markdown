I lived in NorCal this summer while I had an internship in Silicon Valley. Since
the company I worked for gave me some money for shipping, I shipped some of my
possessions from my dorm room such as my TV and Xbox. They made it to California
perfectly alright and gave me a lot of satisfaction while I was out there. When
it came time to ship it back, I left my box with a friend so he could put a few
small items in there and then ship it for me. He choose to ship it with PostNet
and **$500 of insurance** which turned out to be a terrible mistake.

### August

When I received the package at school, I began dutifully unpacking my box and
setting up everything inside. After plugging in my Xbox and TV, I discovered
that the Xbox would turn on but not display video or produce sound. After a
quick Google search, I discovered that the common cause for this was that the
video card had died which is usually caused by heat exposure. I figured that my
box had just been left on a tarmac somewhere. I calmly filed a report with UPS
that my box had been damaged. The report was filed by UPS because that's what
the shipping label had said.

### September

After a long time of not hearing back from UPS, I tried checking their website,
calling them and investigating my account. All of which provided me no new
information. In fact, my account did not even have a record of the claim. After
tweeting angrily about the claim, UPS help responded and had me email them. The
support team had told me that the claim had been offloaded to PostNet and I
should contact them, which I promptly did. PostNet responded that I needed to go
to a repair vendor, such as Best Buy, and get a note about repair or replacement
costs. Since Best Buy was not able to fix my Xbox, I sent back a note and a the
cost of a replacement.

### October

After not hearing from PostNet for a long time, I decided to call them and see
what was happening. They told me that UPS would call me about sending a 
representative to examine the evidence and I thanked them again for their time.
When UPS called me, they asked me if I still had the box. Since I live in a
dorm room, I had thrown it out for space which was a mistake I admit. The UPS
guy told me that was unfortunate but he would see what he could do with PostNet
to help me out because I had insurance on the box.

### November

After sending an email to PostNet, I called them to investigate the status of
the claim. The manager informed me that the claim had been denied. I was mildly
annoyed that they had decided to not tell me at all. The manager claimed that
the UPS agent had told me my claim was denied. When I tried to tell him what the
UPS agent had told me, the manager shut me down and was extremely unhelpful.

## TL;DR

The moral of the story is don't ship with PostNet. Also, probably don't buy
insurance on a package because it doesn't help anyway.

### Notes

* I know I should have kept the box, that was definitely a mistake
