For the last few weeks, I had been working on a website called Alchemr with my
friend and business partner, Sander Kravet. The basic idea of the website was to
allow small content based websites to monetize by creating a paywall that did
consumer surveys. We had some small websites interested and were getting close
to finishing. Unfortunately, Google came out with [Google Consumer Surveys](http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home)
which does the same exact thing and even had the same pricing structure we were
offering. Since our biggest issue was getting websites and business to accept
a new company like Alchemr, competing with Google seemed unwise. While it is
sad to give up on something so close to completion, I learned a lot during the
process and am glad to have had an idea that Google thought was good. The code
is now open source and can be viewed at [https://github.com/pspeter3/alchemr](https://github.com/pspeter3/alchemr).
