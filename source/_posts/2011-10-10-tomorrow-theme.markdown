Hi, everyone, so I'm a big fan of Chris Kempson's Tomorrow Theme which
can be found at <https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme>
For a long time there was no support for GEdit, the wonderful text editor 
for gnome. Recently, I was made aware of a tool for converting Textmate 
themes and made a pull request. You can now find a GEdit version of the 
theme in the repo.
