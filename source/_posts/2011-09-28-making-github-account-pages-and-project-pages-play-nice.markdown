I am a huge fan of github and using them for my projects. Recently, I discovered
the power of their project pages and have been using them to host my javascript
based applications, both for code and display. When I launched my Octopress site
however, my project pages disappeared. In order to make the page come back, all
I needed to do was make a minor change and force the project page to be rebuilt.
Fortunately, you only need to do this once and the changes stick. Hope this
helps.
