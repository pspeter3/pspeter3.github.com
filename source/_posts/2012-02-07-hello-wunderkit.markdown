Last week I wrote a [comparison of various task managers](http://pspeter3.github.com/blog/2012/02/01/comparisons-of-task-managers/),
and talked about how I wanted to look more into [Wunderkit](http://www.wunderkit.com/).
Last night I finally had the opportunity to delve more into it and I have officially
switched to it. The app is just awesome.

## Criteria

When looking for a task manager, I have several criteria that are ideal

1. Due Dates (For a long time Google Tasks didn't have these)
2. Contexts / Workspaces
3. Repeating Tasks (otherwise I forget to change my contacts)
4. Mobile Apps
5. Tagging
6. Collaborative Workspaces

**Wunderkit meets all of them.**
